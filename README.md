#music-chat

## Motivation

I started this Project to get familiar and deepen my skills with the FastAPI framework. Hereby I developed an backend which provides different kinds of functionalities like:

- User
  - registration 
  - sign in
  - authorization

- Contacts
  - create contacts
  - manage requests
  - accept contacts
  - show contacts

- Music
  - upload songs
  - list songs
  - receive playlists
  - music-player to play those songs

- Chat
  - websocket for the connection
  - save those messages
  - load messages
